To merge the pull request, follow these steps:

1. Click **Squash and Merge**.
   (Select this option from the dropdown menu of the merge button, if it is not shown.)
2. Click **Confirm squash and merge**.
3. Click **Delete branch**.


How to make a release
---------------------

*You need to be a project maintainer to make a release.*

Before making a release, go through the following checklist:

-  All pull requests for the release have been merged.
-  The master branch passes all checks.

Releases are made by publishing a GitHub Release.
A draft release is being maintained based on merged pull requests.
To publish the release, follow these steps:

1. Click **Edit** next to the draft release.
2. Enter a tag with the new version.
3. Enter the release title, also the new version.
4. Edit the release description, if required.
5. Click **Publish Release**.

Version numbers adhere to `Calendar Versioning`_,
of the form ``YYYY.MM.DD``.

After publishing the release, the following automated steps are triggered:

- The Git tag is applied to the repository.
- `Read the Docs`_ builds a new stable version of the documentation.
