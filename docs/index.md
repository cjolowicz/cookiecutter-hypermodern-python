## FAQ

### What is this project about?

The mission of this project is to
enable current best practices
through modern Python tooling.

### What makes this project different from other Python templates?

This is a general-purpose template for Python libraries and applications.

Our goals are:

- Focus on simplicity and minimalism
- Promote code quality through automation
- Provide reliable and repeatable processes

The project template is centered around the following tools:

- [Poetry][1] for packaging and dependency management
- [Nox][2] for automation of checks and other development tasks
- [GitHub Actions][3] for continuous integration and delivery

### Why is this Python template called "hypermodern"?

[Hypermodernism] is a school of chess that dates back to more than a century ago.
If this setup ever goes out of fashion,
I can pretend it was my secret plan from the start.
