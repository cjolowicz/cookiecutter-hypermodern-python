Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

About this project
------------------

The |HPC| is a general-purpose template for Python libraries and applications,
released under the `MIT license`_
and hosted on `GitHub <Hypermodern Python Cookiecutter_>`__.

The main objective of this project template is to
enable current best practices
through modern Python tooling.
Our goals are to:

- focus on simplicity and minimalism,
- promote code quality through automation, and
- provide reliable and repeatable processes,

all the way from local testing to publishing releases.

Projects are created from the template using Cookiecutter_,
a project scaffolding tool built on top of the Jinja_ template engine.

The project template is centered around the following tools:

- Poetry_ for packaging and dependency management
- Nox_ for automation of checks and other development tasks
- `GitHub Actions`_ for continuous integration and delivery

   :start-after: features-begin
   :end-before: features-end


Release cadence
---------------

The |HPC| has a monthly release cadence while in alpha status.
Releases happen on the 15th of every month.
We use `Calendar Versioning`_ with a ``YYYY.MM.DD`` versioning scheme.

The current stable release is `2021.4.15`_.

.. _Installation:

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

System requirements
-------------------

You need a recent Linux, Unix, or Mac system with
bash_, curl_, and git_.

On Windows 10, enable the `Windows Subsystem for Linux`_ (WSL) and
install the Ubuntu 20.04 LTS distribution.
Open Ubuntu from the Start Menu, and
install additional packages using the following commands:

.. _Windows Subsystem for Linux: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10

.. code:: console

   $ sudo apt update
   $ sudo apt install -y build-essential curl git libbz2-dev \
     libffi-dev liblzma-dev libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev \
     libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev libssl-dev llvm make \
     python-openssl tk-dev wget xz-utils zlib1g-dev

The project template should also work natively on Windows.
Pull requests to document Windows specifics are welcome!

.. note::

   When working with this template on Windows,
   configure your text editor or IDE
   to use only `UNIX-style line endings`__ (line feeds).

   __ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline

   The project template contains a `.gitattributes`_ file
   which enables end-of-line normalization for your entire working tree.
   Additionally, the Prettier_ code formatter converts line endings to line feeds.
   Windows-style line endings (`CRLF`) should therefore never make it into your Git repository.

   .. _.gitattributes: https://git-scm.com/book/en/Customizing-Git-Git-Attributes

   Nonetheless, configuring your editor for line feeds is recommended
   to avoid complaints from the pre-commit_ hook for Prettier.


Getting Python
--------------

It is recommended to use pyenv_ for
installing and managing Python versions.
Please refer to the documentation of this project
for detailed installation and usage instructions.

Install pyenv_ like this:

.. code:: console

   $ curl https://pyenv.run | bash

Add the following lines to your ``~/.bashrc``:

.. code:: sh

   export PATH="$HOME/.pyenv/bin:$PATH"
   eval "$(pyenv init -)"
   eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"

Install the Python build dependencies for your platform,
using one of the commands listed in the
`official instructions`__.

__ https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/wiki/Common-build-problems

Install the latest point release of every supported Python version.
This project template supports Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9.

.. code:: console

   $ pyenv install 3.6.12
   $ pyenv install 3.7.9
   $ pyenv install 3.8.6
   $ pyenv install 3.9.0

After creating your project (see :ref:`below <Creating a project>`),
you can make these Python versions accessible in the project directory,
using the following command:

.. code:: console

   $ pyenv local 3.9.0 3.8.6 3.7.9 3.6.12

The first version listed is the one used when you type plain ``python``.
Every version can be used by invoking ``python<major.minor>``.
For example, use ``python3.7`` to invoke Python 3.7.


Requirements
------------

.. note::

   It is recommended to use pipx_ to install Python tools
   which are not specific to a single project.
   Please refer to the official documentation
   for detailed installation and usage instructions.
   If you decide to skip ``pipx`` installation,
   use `pip install`_ with the ``--user`` option instead.

.. _pip install: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/

You need four tools to use this template:

- Cookiecutter_ to create projects from the template,
- Poetry_ to manage packaging and dependencies
- Nox_ to automate checks and other tasks
- nox-poetry_ for using Poetry in Nox sessions

Install Cookiecutter_ using pipx:

.. code:: console

   $ pipx install cookiecutter

Install Poetry_ by downloading and running get-poetry.py_:

.. _get-poetry.py: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py

.. code:: console

   $ python get-poetry.py

Install Nox_ and nox-poetry_ using pipx:

.. code:: console

   $ pipx install nox
   $ pipx inject nox nox-poetry


Project creation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _Creating a project:

Creating a project
------------------

Create a project from this template
by pointing Cookiecutter to its `GitHub repository <Hypermodern Python Cookiecutter_>`__.
Use the ``--checkout`` option with the `current stable release <2021.4.15_>`__:

.. code:: console

   $ cookiecutter gh:cjolowicz/cookiecutter-hypermodern-python \
     --checkout="2021.4.15"

Cookiecutter downloads the template,
and asks you a series of questions about project variables,
for example, how you wish your project to be named.
When you have answered these questions,
your project is generated in the current directory,
using a subdirectory with the same name as your project.

Here is a complete list of the project variables defined by this template:

.. table:: Project variables
   :class: hypermodern-table
   :widths: auto

   ================== =============================== ======================
   Variable           Description                     Example
   ================== =============================== ======================
   ``project_name``   Project name on PyPI and GitHub ``hypermodern-python``
   ``package_name``   Import name of the package      ``hypermodern_python``
   ``friendly_name``  Friendly project name           ``Hypermodern Python``
   ``author``         Primary author                  Katherine Johnson
   ``email``          E-mail address of the author    katherine@example.com
   ``github_user``    GitHub username of the author   ``katherine``
   ``version``        Initial project version         ``0.0.0``
   ``license``        The project license             ``MIT``
   ================== =============================== ======================

.. note::

   The initial project version should be the latest release on PyPI_,
   or ``0.0.0`` for an unreleased package.
   See `The Release workflow`_ for details.

Your choices are recorded in the file ``.cookiecutter.json`` in the generated project,
together with the URL of this Cookiecutter template.
Having this JSON_ file in the project makes it possible later on
to update your project with changes from the Cookiecutter template,
using tools such as cupper_.

.. _JSON: https://www.json.org/
.. _cupper: https://github.com/senseyeio/cupper

In the remainder of this guide,
``<project>`` and ``<package>`` are used
to refer to the project and package names, respectively.
By default, their only difference is that
the project name uses hyphens (*kebab case*),
whereas the package name uses underscores (*snake case*).


Uploading to GitHub
-------------------

This project template is designed for use with GitHub_.
After generating the project,
your next steps are to create a Git repository and upload it to GitHub.

Change to the root directory of your new project,
initialize a Git repository, and
create a commit for the initial project structure.
In the commands below,
replace ``<project>`` by the name of your project.

.. code:: console

   $ cd <project>
   $ git init
   $ git add .
   $ git commit

Use the following command to ensure your default branch is called ``main``,
which is the `default branch name for GitHub repositories`__.

__ https://github.com/github/renaming

.. code:: console

   $ git branch --move --force main

Create an empty repository on GitHub_,
using the project name you chose when you generated the project.

.. note::

   Do not include a ``README.md``, ``LICENSE``, or ``.gitignore``.
   These files are provided by the project template.

Finally, upload your repository to GitHub.
In the commands below, replace ``<username>`` by your GitHub username,
and ``<project>`` by the name of your project.

.. code:: console

   $ git remote add origin git@github.com:<username>/<project>.git
   $ git push --set-upstream origin main

Now may be a good time to set up Continuous Integration for your repository.
Refer to the section :ref:`External services`
for detailed instructions.

.. _The initial package:

The initial package
-------------------

You can find the initial Python package in your generated project
under the ``src`` directory::

   src
   └── <package>
       ├── __init__.py
       ├── __main__.py
       └── py.typed

``__init__.py``
   This file declares the directory as a `Python package`_,
   and contains any package initialization code.

   .. _Python package: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packages

``__main__.py``
   The `__main__`__ module defines the entry point for the command-line interface.
   The command-line interface is implemented using the Click_ library,
   and supports ``--help`` and ``--version`` options.
   When the package is installed,
   a script named ``<project>`` is placed
   in the Python installation or virtual environment.
   This allows you to invoke the command-line interface using only the project name:

   .. code:: console

      $ poetry run <project>  # during development
      $ <project>             # after installation

   The command-line interface can also be invoked
   by specifying a Python interpreter and the package name:

   .. code:: console

      $ python -m <package> [<options>]

   __ https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html

``py.typed``
   This is an empty marker file,
   which declares that your package supports typing
   and is distributed with its own type information
   (`PEP 561`_).
   This allows people using your package
   to type-check their Python code against it.


.. _The test suite:

The test suite
--------------

Tests are written using the pytest_ testing framework,
the *de facto* standard for testing in Python.

The test suite is located in the ``tests`` directory::

   tests
   ├── __init__.py
   └── test_main.py

The test suite is `declared as a package`__,
and mirrors the source layout of the package under test.
The file ``test_main.py`` contains tests for the ``__main__`` module.

__ https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/explanation/goodpractices.html#choosing-a-test-layout-import-rules

Initially, the test suite contains a single test case,
checking whether the program exits with a status code of zero.
It also provides a `test fixture`_ using `click.testing.CliRunner`_,
a helper class for invoking the program from within tests.

.. _test fixture: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/explanation/fixtures.html#about-fixtures
.. _click.testing.CliRunner: https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/testing/

For details on how to run the test suite,
refer to the section :ref:`The tests session`.


.. _Documentation:

Documentation
-------------

The project documentation is written in reStructuredText_
and processed by the Sphinx_ documentation engine.

The top-level directory contains several stand-alone documentation files:

``README.rst``
   This file is your main project page and displayed on GitHub and PyPI.

``CONTRIBUTING.rst``
   The Contributor Guide explains how other people can contribute to your project.

``CODE_OF_CONDUCT.rst``
   The Code of Conduct outlines the behavior
   expected from participants of your project.
   It is adapted from the `Contributor Covenant`_, version 2.0.

.. _Contributor Covenant: https://www.contributor-covenant.org

``LICENSE.rst``
   This file contains the text of your project's license.

.. note::

   The files above are also rendered on GitHub and PyPI.
   Keep them in plain reStructuredText, without Sphinx extensions.

The documentation files in the ``docs`` directory are built using Sphinx_:

``index.rst``
   This is the main documentation page.
   This file also defines the navigation menu,
   with links to other documentation pages.
   The *Changelog* menu entry
   links to the `GitHub Releases <GitHub Release_>`__ page of your project.

``contributing.rst``
   This file includes the Contributor Guide from ``CONTRIBUTING.rst``.

``codeofconduct.rst``
   This file includes the Code of Conduct from ``CODE_OF_CONDUCT.rst``.

``license.rst``
   This file includes the license from ``LICENSE.rst``.

``reference.rst``
   The API reference for your project.
   It is generated from docstrings and type annotations in the source code,
   using the autodoc_ and napoleon_ extensions.

``usage.rst``
   The command-line reference for your project.
   It is generated by inspecting the click_ entry-point in your package,
   using the sphinx-click_ extension.

The ``docs`` directory contains two more files:

``conf.py``
   This Python file contains the `Sphinx configuration`__.

__ https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html

``requirements.txt``
   The requirements file pins the build dependencies for the Sphinx documentation.
   This file is only used on Read the Docs.

The project documentation is built and hosted on
:ref:`Read the Docs <Read the Docs integration>`,
and uses their official theme sphinx-rtd-theme_.

You can also build the documentation locally using Nox,
see :ref:`The docs session`.


Packaging
~~~~~~~~~

.. _The pyproject.toml file:

The pyproject.toml file
-----------------------

The configuration file for the Python package is located
in the root directory of the project,
and named ``pyproject.toml``.
It uses the TOML_ configuration file format,
and contains two sections---*tables* in TOML parlance---,
specified in `PEP 517`_ and `518 <PEP 518_>`__:

- The ``build-system`` table
  declares the requirements and the entry point
  used to build a distribution package for the project.
  This template uses Poetry_ as the build system.
- The ``tool`` table contains sub-tables
  where tools can store configuration under their PyPI_ name.
  Poetry stores its configuration in the ``tool.poetry`` table.
  Coverage.py_ stores its configuration in the ``tool.coverage`` table.

The ``tool.poetry`` table
contains the metadata for your package,
such as its name, version, and authors,
as well as the list of dependencies for the package.
Please refer to the `Poetry documentation <pyproject.toml_>`__
for a detailed description of each configuration key.

.. _pyproject.toml: https://python-poetry.org/docs/pyproject/


Version constraints
-------------------

`Version constraints <Versions and constraints_>`_ express
which versions of dependencies are compatible with your project.
In the case of core dependencies,
they are also a part of distribution packages,
and as such affect end-users of your package.

For every dependency added to your project,
Poetry writes a version constraint to ``pyproject.toml``.
Dependencies are kept in two TOML tables:

- ``tool.poetry.dependencies``---for core dependencies
- ``tool.poetry.dev-dependencies``---for development dependencies

By default, version constraints require users to have at least
the version that was current when the dependency was added to the project.
Users can also upgrade to newer releases of dependencies,
as long as the version number does not indicate a breaking change.
(According to the `Semantic Versioning`_ standard,
only major releases may contain breaking changes,
once a project has reached version 1.0.0.)

.. _Versions and constraints: https://python-poetry.org/docs/versions/
.. _Semantic Versioning: https://semver.org/

.. note::

   Dependencies are Python packages used by your project,
   and they come in two types:

   - *Core dependencies* are required by users running your code,
     and typically consist of third-party libraries imported by your package.
     When your package is distributed,
     the package metainfo includes these dependencies,
     allowing tools like pip_ to automatically install them alongside your package.

   - *Development dependencies* are only required by developers working on your code.
     Examples are applications used to run tests,
     check code for style and correctness,
     or to build documentation.
     These dependencies are not a part of distribution packages,
     because users do not require them to run your code.


.. _The lock file:

The lock file
-------------

Poetry records the exact version of each direct and indirect dependency
in its lock file, named ``poetry.lock`` and located in the root directory of the project.
The lock file does not affect users of the package,
because its contents are not included in distribution packages.

The lock file is useful for a number of reasons:

- It ensures that local checks run in the same environment as on the CI server,
  making the CI predictable and deterministic.
- When collaborating with other developers,
  it allows everybody to use the same development environment.
- When deploying an application, the lock file helps you
  keep production and development environments as similar as possible
  (`dev-prod parity`_).

.. _dev-prod parity: https://12factor.net/dev-prod-parity

For these reasons, the lock file should be kept under source control.


Dependencies
------------

This project template has a core dependency on Click_,
a library for creating command-line interfaces.
The template also comes with various development dependencies.
See the table below for an overview of the dependencies of generated projects:

.. table:: Dependencies

.. code:: console

   $ poetry show

.. _poetry show: https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#show

Use the command `poetry add`_ to add a dependency for your package:

.. code:: console

   $ poetry add foobar        # for core dependencies
   $ poetry add --dev foobar  # for development dependencies

Use the command `poetry remove`_ to remove a dependency from your package:

.. code:: console

   $ poetry remove foobar

.. _poetry remove: https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#remove

Use the command `poetry update`_ to upgrade the dependency to a new release:

.. code:: console

   $ poetry update foobar

.. _poetry update: https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#update

To upgrade to a new major release,
you normally need to update the version constraint for the dependency,
in the ``pyproject.toml`` file.

.. note::

   Dependencies in the |HPC| are managed by :ref:`Dependabot <Dependabot integration>`.
   When newer versions of dependencies become available,
   Dependabot updates the ``pyproject.toml`` and ``poetry.lock`` files and submits a pull request.


Installing the package for development
--------------------------------------

Poetry manages a virtual environment for your project,
which contains your package, its core dependencies, and the development dependencies.
All dependencies are kept at the versions specified by the lock file.

.. note::

   A `virtual environment`_ gives your project
   an isolated runtime environment,
   consisting of a specific Python version and
   an independent set of installed Python packages.
   This way, the dependencies of your current project
   do not interfere with the system-wide Python installation,
   or other projects you're working on.

   .. _virtual environment: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html

You can install your package and its dependencies
into Poetry's virtual environment
using the command `poetry install`_.

.. code:: console

   $ poetry install

.. _poetry install: https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#install

This command performs a so-called `editable install`__ of your package:
Instead of building and installing a distribution package,
it creates a special ``.egg-link`` file that links to your local source code.
This means that code edits are directly visible in the environment
without the need to reinstall your package.

__ https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install/#install-editable

Installing your package implicitly creates the virtual environment
if it does not exist yet,
using the currently active Python interpreter,
or the first one found
which satisfies the Python versions supported by your project.


Managing environments
---------------------

You can create environments explicitly
with the `poetry env`_ command,
specifying the desired Python version.
This allows you to create an environment
for every Python version supported by your project,
and easily switch between them:

.. _poetry env: https://python-poetry.org/docs/managing-environments/

.. code:: console

   $ poetry env use 3.6
   $ poetry env use 3.7
   $ poetry env use 3.8
   $ poetry env use 3.9

Only one Poetry environment can be active at any time.
Note that ``3.9`` comes last,
to ensure that the current Python release is the active environment.
Install your package with ``poetry install`` into each environment after creating it.

Use the command ``poetry env list`` to list the available environments:

.. code:: console

   $ poetry env list

Use the command ``poetry env remove`` to remove an environment:

.. code:: console

   $ poetry env remove <version>

Use the command ``poetry env info`` to show information about the active environment:

.. code:: console

   $ poetry env info


Running commands
----------------

You can run an interactive Python session inside the active environment
using the command `poetry run`_:

.. _poetry run: https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#run

.. code:: console

   $ poetry run python

The same command allows you to invoke the command-line interface of your project:

.. code:: console

   $ poetry run <project>

You can also run developer tools, such as pytest_:

.. code:: console

   $ poetry run pytest

While it is handy to have developer tools available in the Poetry environment,
it is usually recommended to run these using Nox,
as described in the section :ref:`Using Nox`.


Building and distributing the package
-------------------------------------

.. note::

   With the |HPC|,
   building and distributing your package
   is taken care of by `GitHub Actions`_.
   For more information,
   see the section :ref:`The Release workflow`.

This section gives a short overview of
how you can build and distribute your package
from the command line,
using the following Poetry commands:

.. code:: console

   $ poetry build
   $ poetry publish

Building the package is done with the `python build`_ command,
which generates *distribution packages*
in the ``dist`` directory of your project.
These are compressed archives that
an end-user can download and install on their system.
They come in two flavours:
source (or *sdist*) archives, and
binary packages in the wheel_ format.

Publishing the package is done with the `python publish`_ command,
which uploads the distribution packages
to your account on PyPI_,
the official Python package registry.

.. _python build: https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#build
.. _python publish: https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#publish
.. _wheel: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0427/


Installing the package
----------------------

Once your package is on PyPI,
others can install it with pip_, pipx_, or Poetry:

.. code:: console

   $ pip install <project>
   $ pipx install <project>
   $ poetry add <project>

While pip_ is the workhorse of the Python packaging ecosystem,
you should use higher-level tools to install your package:

- If the package is an application, install it with pipx_.
- If the package is a library, install it with `poetry add`_ in other projects.

The primary benefit of these installation methods is that
your package is installed into an isolated environment,
without polluting the system environment,
or the environments of other applications.
This way,
applications can use specific versions of their direct and indirect dependencies,
without getting in each other's way.

.. _poetry add: https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#add

If the other project is not managed by Poetry,
use whatever package manager the other project uses.
You can always install your project into a virtual environment with plain pip_.


.. _Using Nox:

Using Nox
~~~~~~~~~

Nox_ automates testing in multiple Python environments.
Like its older sibling tox_,
Nox makes it easy to run any kind of job in an isolated environment,
with only those dependencies installed that the job needs.

.. _tox: https://tox.readthedocs.io/

Nox sessions are defined in a Python file
named ``noxfile.py`` and located in the project directory.
They consist of a virtual environment
and a set of commands to run in that environment.

While Poetry environments allow you to
interact with your package during development,
Nox environments are used to run developer tools
in a reliable and repeatable way across Python versions.

Most sessions are run with every supported Python version.
Other sessions are only run with the current stable Python version,
for example the session used to build the documentation.


Running sessions
----------------

If you invoke Nox by itself, it will run the full test suite:

.. code:: console

   $ nox

This includes tests, linters, type checks, and more.
For the full list, please refer to the table `below <Table of Nox sessions_>`_.

The list of sessions run by default can be configured
by editing ``nox.options.sessions`` in ``noxfile.py``.
Currently the list only excludes the `docs session <The docs session_>`_
(which spawns an HTTP server)
and the `coverage session <The coverage session_>`_
(which is triggered by the `tests session <The tests session_>`_).

You can also run a specific Nox session, using the ``--session`` option.
For example, build the documentation like this:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --session=docs

Print a list of the available Nox sessions
using the ``--list-sessions`` option:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --list-sessions

Nox creates virtual environments from scratch on each invocation.
You can speed things up by passing the
`--reuse-existing-virtualenvs`_ option,
or the equivalent short option ``-r``.
For example, the following may be more practical during development
(this will only run tests and type checks, on the current Python release):

.. code:: console

   $ nox -p 3.9 -rs tests mypy

.. _--reuse-existing-virtualenvs: https://nox.thea.codes/en/stable/usage.html#re-using-virtualenvs

Many sessions accept additional options after ``--`` separator.
For example, the following command runs a specific test module:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --session=tests -- tests/test_main.py


Overview of Nox sessions
------------------------

.. _Table of Nox sessions:

The following table gives an overview of the available Nox sessions:

.. table:: Nox sessions
   :class: hypermodern-table
   :widths: auto

   ========================================== ===================================== ================== =========


.. _The docs session:

The docs session
----------------

Build the documentation using the Nox session ``docs``:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --session=docs

The docs session runs the command ``sphinx-autobuild`` to generate the HTML documentation from the Sphinx directory.
This tool has several advantages over ``sphinx-build`` when you are editing the documentation files:

- It rebuilds the documentation whenever a change is detected.
- It spins up a web server with live reloading.
- It opens the location of the web server in your browser.

Use the ``--`` separator to pass additional options.
For example, to treat warnings as errors and run in nit-picky mode:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --session=docs -- -W -n docs docs/_build

This Nox session always runs with the current major release of Python.


.. _The docs-build session:

The docs-build session
----------------------

The ``docs-build`` session runs the command ``sphinx-build`` to generate the HTML documentation from the Sphinx directory.

This session is meant to be run as a part of automated checks.
Use the interactive ``docs`` session instead while you're editing the documentation.

This Nox session always runs with the current major release of Python.


.. _The mypy session:

The mypy session
----------------

mypy_ is the pioneer and *de facto* reference implementation of static type checking in Python.
Learn more about it in the section :ref:`Type-checking with mypy`.

Run mypy using Nox:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --session=mypy

You can also run the type checker with a specific Python version.
For example, the following command runs mypy
using the current stable release of Python:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --session=mypy --python=3.9

Use the separator ``--`` to pass additional options and arguments to ``mypy``.
For example, the following command type-checks only the ``__main__`` module:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --session=mypy -- src/<package>/__main__.py


.. _The pre-commit session:

The pre-commit session
----------------------

pre-commit_ is a multi-language linter framework and a Git hook manager.
Learn more about it in the section :ref:`Linting with pre-commit`.

Run pre-commit from Nox using the ``pre-commit`` session:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --session=pre-commit

This session always runs with the current stable release of Python.

Use the separator ``--`` to pass additional options to ``pre-commit``.
For example, the following command installs the pre-commit hooks,
so they run automatically on every commit you make:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --session=pre-commit -- install


.. _The safety session:

The safety session
------------------

Safety_ checks the dependencies of your project for known security vulnerabilities,
using a curated database of insecure Python packages.
The |HPC| uses the `poetry export`_ command
to convert Poetry's lock file to a `requirements file`_,
for consumption by Safety.

.. _poetry export: https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#export
.. _requirements file: https://pip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide/#requirements-files

Run Safety_ using the ``safety`` session:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --session=safety

This session always runs with the current stable release of Python.


.. _The tests session:

The tests session
-----------------

Tests are written using the pytest_ testing framework.
Learn more about it in the section :ref:`The test suite`.

Run the test suite using the Nox session ``tests``:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --session=tests

The tests session runs the test suite against the installed code.
More specifically, the session builds a wheel from your project and
installs it into the Nox environment,
with dependencies pinned as specified by Poetry's lock file.

You can also run the test suite with a specific Python version.
For example, the following command runs the test suite
using the current stable release of Python:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --session=tests --python=3.9

Use the separator ``--`` to pass additional options to ``pytest``.
For example, the following command runs only the test case ``test_main_succeeds``:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --session=tests -- -k test_main_succeeds

The tests session also installs pygments_, a Python syntax highlighter.
It is used by pytest to highlight code in tracebacks,
improving the readability of test failures.


.. _The coverage session:

The coverage session
--------------------

.. note::

   *Test coverage* is a measure of the degree to which
   the source code of your program is executed
   while running its test suite.

The coverage session prints a detailed coverage report to the terminal,
combining the coverage data collected
during the :ref:`tests session <The tests session>`.
If the total coverage is below 100%,
the coverage session fails.
Code coverage is measured using `Coverage.py`_.

The coverage session is triggered by the tests session,
and runs after all other sessions have completed.
This allows it to combine the coverage data for different Python versions.

You can also run the session manually:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --session=coverage

Use the ``--`` separator to pass arguments to the ``coverage`` command.
For example, here's how you would generate an HTML report
in the ``htmlcov`` directory:

.. code:: console

   $ nox -rs coverage -- html

Coverage.py_ is configured in the ``pyproject.toml`` file,
using the ``tool.coverage`` table.
The configuration informs the tool about your package name and source tree layout.
It also enables branch analysis and the display of line numbers for missing coverage,
and specifies the target coverage percentage.

During continuous integration,
coverage data is uploaded to the Codecov_ reporting service.
For details, see the sections about
:ref:`Codecov <Codecov integration>` and
:ref:`The Tests workflow`.


.. _The typeguard session:

The typeguard session
---------------------

Typeguard_ is a runtime type checker and pytest_ plugin.
It can type-check function calls during test runs via an `import hook`__.

__ https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#import-hooks

Typeguard checks that arguments passed to functions
match the type annotations of the function parameters,
and that the return value provided by the function
matches the return type annotation.
In the case of generator functions,
Typeguard checks the yields, sends and the return value
against the ``Generator`` annotation.

Run Typeguard_ using Nox:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --session=typeguard

The typeguard session runs the test suite with runtime type-checking enabled.
It is similar to the :ref:`tests session <The tests session>`,
with the difference that your package is instrumented by Typeguard.

You can run the session with a specific Python version.
For example, the following command runs the session
with the current stable release of Python:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --session=typeguard --python=3.9

Use the separator ``--`` to pass additional options and arguments to pytest.
For example, the following command runs only tests for the ``__main__`` module:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --session=typeguard -- tests/test_main.py

.. note::

   Typeguard generates a warning about missing type annotations for a Click object.
   This is due to the fact that ``__main__.main`` is wrapped by a decorator,
   and its type annotations only apply to the inner function,
   not the resulting object as seen by the test suite.


.. _The xdoctest session:

The xdoctest session
--------------------

The xdoctest_ tool
runs examples in your docstrings and
compares the actual output to the expected output as per the docstring.
This serves multiple purposes:

- The example is checked for correctness.
- You ensure that the documentation is up-to-date.
- Your codebase gets additional test coverage for free.

Run the tool using the Nox session ``xdoctest``:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --session=xdoctest

You can also run the test suite with a specific Python version.
For example, the following command runs the examples
using the current stable release of Python:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --session=xdoctest --python=3.9

By default, the Nox session uses the ``all`` subcommand to run all examples.
You can also list examples using the ``list`` subcommand,
or run specific examples:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --session=xdoctest -- list


.. _Linting with pre-commit:

Linting with pre-commit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

pre-commit_ is a multi-language linter framework and a Git hook manager.
It allows you to
integrate linters and formatters into your Git workflow,
even when written in a language other than Python.

pre-commit is configured using the file ``.pre-commit-config.yaml``
in the project directory.
Please refer to the `official documentation`__
for details about the configuration file.

__ https://pre-commit.com/#adding-pre-commit-plugins-to-your-project


Running pre-commit from Nox
---------------------------

pre-commit runs in a Nox session every time you invoke ``nox``:

.. code:: console

   $ nox

Run the pre-commit session explicitly like this:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --session=pre-commit

The session is described in more detail in the section :ref:`The pre-commit session`.


Running pre-commit from git
---------------------------

When installed as a `Git hook`_,
pre-commit runs automatically every time you invoke ``git commit``.
The commit is aborted if any check fails.
When invoked in this mode, pre-commit only runs on files staged for the commit.

.. _Git hook: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks

Install pre-commit as a Git hook by running the following command:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --session=pre-commit -- install


Managing hooks with pre-commit
------------------------------

Hooks in languages other than Python, such as ``prettier``,
run in isolated environments managed by pre-commit.
To upgrade these hooks, use the autoupdate__ command:

__ https://pre-commit.com/#pre-commit-autoupdate

.. code:: console

   $ nox --session=pre-commit -- autoupdate


Python-language hooks
---------------------

.. note::

   This section provides some background information about
   how this project template integrates pre-commit with Poetry and Nox.
   You can safely skip this section.

Python-language hooks in the |HPC| are not managed by pre-commit.
Instead, they are tracked as development dependencies in Poetry,
and installed into the Nox session alongside pre-commit itself.
As development dependencies, they are also present in the Poetry environment.

This approach has some advantages:

- All project dependencies are managed by Poetry.
- Hooks receive automatic upgrades from Dependabot.
- Nox can serve as a single entry point for all checks.
- Additional hook dependencies can be upgraded by a dependency manager.
  An example for this are Flake8 extensions.
  By contrast, ``pre-commit autoupdate`` does not include additional dependencies.
- Dependencies of dependencies (*subdependencies*) can be locked automatically,
  making checks more repeatable and deterministic.
- Linters and formatters are available in the Poetry environment,
  which is useful for editor integration.

There are also some drawbacks to this technique:

- This is not the officially supported way to integrate pre-commit hooks.
- The hook scripts installed by pre-commit do not activate the virtual environment
  in which pre-commit and the hooks are installed.
  To work around this limitation,
  the Nox session patches hook scripts on installation.
- Adding a hook is more work,
  including updating ``pyproject.toml`` and ``noxfile.py``, and
  adding the hook definition to ``pre-commit-config.yaml``.

You can always opt out of this integration method,
by removing the ``repo: local`` section from the configuration file,
and adding the official pre-commit hooks instead.
Don't forget to remove the hooks from Poetry's dependencies and from the Nox session.

.. note::

   Python-language hooks in the |HPC| are defined as `system hooks`__.
   System hooks don't have their environments managed by pre-commit;
   instead, pre-commit assumes that hook dependencies have already been installed
   and are available in its environment.
   The Nox session for pre-commit takes care of
   installing the Python hooks alongside pre-commit.

   __ https://pre-commit.com/#system

   Furthermore, the |HPC| defines Python-language hooks as `repository-local hooks`__.
   As such, hook definitions are not supplied by the hook repositories,
   but by the project itself.
   This makes it possible to override the hook language to ``system``, as explained above.

   __ https://pre-commit.com/#repository-local-hooks


Adding an official pre-commit hook
----------------------------------

Adding the official pre-commit hook for a linter is straightforward.
Often you can simply copy a configuration snippet from the repository's ``README``.
Otherwise, note the hook identifier from the ``pre-commit-hooks.yaml`` file,
and the git tag for the latest version.
Add the following section to your ``pre-commit-config.yaml``, under ``repos``:

.. code:: yaml

   - repo: <hook repository>
     rev: <version tag>
     hooks:
       - id: <hook identifier>

While this technique also works for Python-language hooks,
it is recommended to integrate Python hooks with Nox and Poetry,
as shown in the next section.


Adding a Python-language hook
-----------------------------

Adding a Python-language hook to your project takes three steps:

- Add the hook as a Poetry development dependency.
- Install the hook in the Nox session for pre-commit.
- Add the hook to ``pre-commit-config.yaml``.

For example, consider a linter named ``awesome-linter``.

First, use Poetry to add the linter to your development dependencies:

.. code:: console

   $ poetry add --dev awesome-linter

Next, update ``noxfile.py`` to add the linter to the pre-commit session:

.. code:: python

   @nox.session(name="pre-commit", ...)
   def precommit(session: Session) -> None:
       ...
       session.install(
           "awesome-linter",  # Install awesome-linter
           "black",
           "darglint",
           ...
       )

Finally, add the hook to ``pre-commit-config.yaml`` as follows:

- Locate the ``pre-commit-hooks.yaml`` file in the ``awesome-linter`` repository.
- Copy the entry for the hook (not just the hook identifier).
- Change ``language:`` from ``python`` to ``system``.
- Add the hook definition to the ``repo: local`` section.

Depending on the linter, the hook definition might look somewhat like the following:

.. code:: yaml

   repos:
     - repo: local
       hooks:
         # ...
         - id: awesome-linter
           name: Awesome Linter
           entry: awesome-linter
           language: system  # was: python
           types: [python]


Running checks on modified files
--------------------------------

pre-commit runs checks on the *staged* contents of files.
Any local modifications are stashed for the duration of the checks.
This is motivated by pre-commit's primary use case,
validating changes staged for a commit.

Requiring changes to be staged allows for a nice property:
Many pre-commit hooks support fixing offending lines automatically,
for example ``black``, ``prettier``, and ``reorder-python-imports``.
When this happens,
your original changes are in the staging area,
while the fixes are in the work tree.
You can accept the fixes by staging them with ``git add``
before committing again.

If you want to run linters or formatters on modified files,
and you do not want to stage the modifications just yet,
you can also invoke the tools via Poetry instead.
For example, use ``poetry run flake8 <file>`` to lint a modified file with Flake8.


Overview of pre-commit hooks
----------------------------

The |HPC| comes with a pre-commit configuration consisting of the following hooks:

.. table:: pre-commit hooks
   :class: hypermodern-table
   :widths: auto

   ======================== ===============================================
   `black <Black_>`__       Run the Black_ code formatter
   `flake8 <Flake8_>`__     Run the Flake8_ linter
   `prettier <Prettier_>`__ Run the Prettier_ code formatter
   check-added-large-files_ Prevent giant files from being committed
   check-toml_              Validate TOML_ files
   check-yaml_              Validate YAML_ files
   end-of-file-fixer_       Ensure files are terminated by a single newline
   reorder-python-imports_  Rewrites source to reorder python imports
   trailing-whitespace_     Ensure lines do not contain trailing whitespace
   ======================== ===============================================

.. _check-toml: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks#check-toml
.. _check-yaml: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks#check-yaml
.. _check-added-large-files: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks#check-added-large-files
.. _end-of-file-fixer: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks#end-of-file-fixer
.. _trailing-whitespace: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks#trailing-whitespace


The Black hook
--------------

Black_ is the uncompromising Python code formatter.
One of its greatest features is its lack of configurability.
Blackened code looks the same regardless of the project you're reading.


The Prettier hook
-----------------

Prettier_ is an opinionated code formatter for many languages,
including YAML, Markdown, and JavaScript.
Like Black, it has few options,
and the |HPC| uses none of them.


.. _The Flake8 hook:

The Flake8 hook
---------------

Flake8_ is an extensible linter framework for Python.
For more details, see the section :ref:`Linting with Flake8`.


The reorder-python-imports hook
-------------------------------

reorder-python-imports_ sorts imports in your Python code.
Imports are separated into three sections,
as recommended by `PEP 8`_: standard library, third party, first party.
The tool also splits ``from`` imports onto separate lines to avoid merge conflicts,
and moves them after normal imports.
Any duplicate imports are removed.


Hooks from pre-commit-hooks
---------------------------

The pre-commit configuration also includes several smaller hooks
from the pre-commit-hooks_ repository.


.. _Linting with Flake8:

Linting with Flake8
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Flake8_ is an extensible linter framework for Python,
and a command-line utility to run the linters on your source code.
The |HPC| integrates Flake8 via a pre-commit_ hook,
see the section :ref:`The Flake8 hook`.

The configuration file for Flake8 and its extensions
is named ``.flake8`` and located in the project directory.
For details about the configuration file, see the `official reference`__.

__ https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/configuration.html

The sections below describe the linters in more detail.
Each section also notes any configuration settings applied by the |HPC|.


Overview of available plugins
-----------------------------

Flake8 comes with a rich ecosystem of plugins.
The following table lists the Flake8 plugins used by the |HPC|,
and links to their lists of error codes.

   ================================ ============================================= ======================================


pyflakes
--------

pyflakes_ parses Python source files and finds invalid code.
Warnings reported by this tool include
syntax errors,
undefined names,
unused imports or variables,
and more.
It is included with Flake8_ by default.

`Error codes`__ are prefixed by ``F`` for "flake".

.. _pyflakes codes:
__ https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/error-codes.html


pycodestyle
-----------

pycodestyle_ checks your code against the style recommendations of `PEP 8`_,
the official Python style guide.
The tool detects
whitespace and indentation issues,
deprecated features,
bare excepts,
and much more.
It is included with Flake8_ by default.

`Error codes`__ are prefixed by ``W`` for warnings and ``E`` for errors.

.. _pycodestyle codes:
__ https://pycodestyle.pycqa.org/en/latest/intro.html#error-codes

The |HPC| disables the following errors and warnings
for compatibility with Black_ and flake8-bugbear_:

- ``E203`` (whitespace before ``:``)
- ``E501`` (line too long)
- ``W503`` (line break before binary operator)


pep8-naming
-----------

pep8-naming_ enforces the naming conventions from `PEP 8`_.
Examples are the use of camel case for the names of classes,
the use of lowercase for the names of functions, arguments and variables,
or the convention to name the first argument of methods ``self``.

`Error codes`__ are prefixed by ``N`` for "naming".

.. _pep8-naming codes:
__ https://github.com/pycqa/pep8-naming#pep-8-naming-conventions


pydocstyle and flake8-docstrings
--------------------------------

pydocstyle_ checks that docstrings comply with the recommendations of `PEP 257`_
and a configurable style convention.
It is integrated with Flake8 via the flake8-docstrings_ extension.
Warnings range from missing docstrings to
issues with whitespace, quoting, and docstring content.

`Error codes`__ are prefixed by ``D`` for "docstring".

.. _pydocstyle codes:
__ http://www.pydocstyle.org/en/stable/error_codes.html

The |HPC| selects the recommendations of the
`Google styleguide <Google docstring style_>`__.
Here is an example of a function documented in Google style:

.. code:: python

   def add(first: int, second: int) -> int:
       """Add two integers.

       Args:
           first: The first argument.
           second: The second argument.

       Returns:
           The sum of the arguments.
       """

.. _Google docstring style: https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings


flake8-rst-docstrings
---------------------

flake8-rst-docstrings_ validates docstring markup as reStructuredText_.
Docstrings must be valid reStructuredText
because they are used by Sphinx to generate the API reference.

`Error codes`__ are prefixed by ``RST`` for "reStructuredText",
and group issues into numerical blocks, by their severity and origin.

.. _flake8-rst-docstrings codes:
__ https://github.com/peterjc/flake8-rst-docstrings#flake8-validation-codes


flake8-bugbear
--------------

flake8-bugbear_ detects bugs and design problems.
The warnings are more opinionated than those of pyflakes or pycodestyle.
For example,
the plugin detects Python 2 constructs which have been removed in Python 3,
and likely bugs such as function arguments defaulting to empty lists or dictionaries.

`Error codes`__ are prefixed by ``B`` for "bugbear".

.. _flake8-bugbear codes:
__ https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8-bugbear#list-of-warnings

The |HPC| also enables Bugbear's ``B9`` warnings,
which are disabled by default.
In particular, ``B950`` checks the maximum line length
like pycodestyle_'s ``E501``,
but with a tolerance margin of 10%.
This soft limit is set to 80 characters,
which is the value used by the Black code formatter.


mccabe
------

mccabe_ checks the `code complexity <Cyclomatic complexity_>`__
of your Python package against a configured limit.
The tool is included with Flake8_.

`Error codes`__ are prefixed by ``C`` for "complexity".

.. _mccabe codes:
__ https://github.com/PyCQA/mccabe#plugin-for-flake8

The |HPC| limits code complexity to a value of 10.

.. _Cyclomatic complexity: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity


.. _darglint integration:

darglint
--------

darglint_ checks that docstring descriptions match function definitions.
The tool has its own configuration file, named ``.darglint``.

`Error codes`__ are prefixed by ``DAR`` for "darglint".

.. _darglint codes:
__ https://github.com/terrencepreilly/darglint#error-codes

The |HPC| allows one-line docstrings without function signatures.
Multi-line docstrings must
specify the function signatures completely and correctly,
using `Google docstring style`_.


Bandit
------

Bandit_ is a tool designed to
find common security issues in Python code,
and integrated via the flake8-bandit_ extension.

`Error codes`__ are prefixed by ``S`` for "security".
(The prefix ``B`` for "bandit" is used
when Bandit is run as a stand-alone tool.)

.. _Bandit codes:
__ https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins/index.html#complete-test-plugin-listing

The |HPC| disables ``S101`` (use of assert) for the test suite,
as pytest_ uses assertions to verify expectations in tests.


.. _Type-checking with mypy:

Type-checking with mypy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   `Type annotations`_, first introduced in Python 3.5,
   are a way to annotate functions and variables with types.
   With appropriate tooling,
   they can make your programs easier to understand, debug, and maintain.

   .. _Type annotations: https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html

   *Type-checking* refers to the practice of
   verifying the type correctness of a program,
   using type annotations and type inference.
   There are two kinds of type checkers:

   - *Static type checkers* verify the type correctness of your program
     without executing it, using static analysis.
   - *Runtime type checkers* find type errors by instrumenting your code to
     type-check arguments and return values in function calls.
     This is particularly useful during the execution of unit tests.

   There is also an increasing number of libraries
   that leverage type annotations at runtime.
   For example, you can use type annotations to generate serialization schemas
   or command-line parsers.

mypy_ is the pioneer and *de facto* reference implementation of static type checking in Python.
Invoke mypy via Nox, as explained in the section :ref:`The mypy session`.

Configure mypy using the ``mypy.ini`` configuration file in the project directory.
For details about supported configuration options, see the `official reference`__.

__ https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config_file.html

The |HPC| enables several configuration options which are off by default.
The following options are enabled for strictness and enhanced output:

- :option:`strict <mypy --strict>`
- :option:`pretty <mypy --pretty>`
- :option:`show_column_numbers <mypy --show-column-numbers>`
- :option:`show_error_codes <mypy --show-error-codes>`
- :option:`show_error_context <mypy --show-error-context>`


.. _External services:

External services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your GitHub repository can be integrated with several external services
for continuous integration and delivery.
This section describes these external services,
what they do, and how to set them up for your repository.


PyPI
----

PyPI_ is the official Python Package Index.
Uploading your package to PyPI allows others to
download and install it to their system.

Follow these steps to set up PyPI for your repository:

1. Sign up at PyPI_.
2. Go to the Account Settings on PyPI,
   generate an API token, and copy it.
3. Go to the repository settings on GitHub, and
   add a secret named ``PYPI_TOKEN`` with the token you just copied.

PyPI is integrated with your repository
via the :ref:`Release workflow <The Release workflow>`.


TestPyPI
--------

TestPyPI_ is a test instance of the Python package registry.
It allows you to check your release before uploading it to the real index.

Follow these steps to set up TestPyPI for your repository:

1. Sign up at TestPyPI_.
2. Go to the Account Settings on TestPyPI,
   generate an API token, and copy it.
3. Go to the repository settings on GitHub, and
   add a secret named ``TEST_PYPI_TOKEN`` with the token you just copied.

TestPyPI is integrated with your repository
via the :ref:`Release workflow <The Release workflow>`.


.. _Codecov integration:

Codecov
-------

Codecov_ is a reporting service for code coverage.

Follow these steps to set up Codecov for your repository:

1. Sign up at Codecov_.
2. Install their GitHub app.

The configuration is included in the repository,
in the file `codecov.yml`__.

__ https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-yaml

Codecov integrates with your repository
via its GitHub app.
The :ref:`Tests workflow <The Tests workflow>` uploads the coverage data.


.. _Dependabot integration:

Dependabot
----------

Dependabot_ creates pull requests with automated dependency updates.


Please refer to the `official documentation`__ for more details.

__ https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/keeping-your-dependencies-updated-automatically

The configuration is included in the repository,
in the file `.github/dependabot.yml`__.

__ https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/configuration-options-for-dependency-updates


It manages the following dependencies:

.. table::
   :class: hypermodern-table
   :widths: auto

   =================== ===================================== ================================================
   Type of dependency  Managed files                         See also
   =================== ===================================== ================================================
   Python              | ``pyproject.toml``                  :ref:`Managing Dependencies`
                       | ``poetry.lock``
   Python              ``docs/requirements.txt``             :ref:`Read the Docs <Read the Docs integration>`
   Python              ``.github/workflows/constraints.txt`` :ref:`Workflow constraints`
   GitHub Action       ``.github/workflows/*.yml``           :ref:`GitHub Actions workflows`
   =================== ===================================== ================================================


.. _Read the Docs integration:

Read the Docs
-------------

`Read the Docs`_ automates the building, versioning, and hosting of documentation.

Follow these steps to set up Read the Docs for your repository:

1. Sign up at `Read the Docs`_.
2. Import your GitHub repository,
   using the button *Import a Project*.
3. Install the GitHub webhook__,
   using the button *Add integration*
   on the *Integrations* tab
   in the *Admin* section of your project
   on Read the Docs.

__ https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/webhooks.html

Read the Docs automatically starts building your documentation,
and will continue to do so when you push to the default branch or make a release.
Your documentation now has a public URL like this:

   *https://<project>.readthedocs.io/*

The configuration for Read the Docs is included in the repository,
in the file `.readthedocs.yml`__.
The |HPC| configures Read the Docs
to build and install the package with Poetry,
using a so-called `PEP 517`_-build.

__ https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config-file/v2.html

Build dependencies for the documentation
are installed using a `requirements file`_ located at ``docs/requirements.txt``.
Read the Docs currently does not support
installing development dependencies using Poetry's lock file.
For the sake of brevity and maintainability,
only direct dependencies are included.

.. note::

   The requirements file is managed by :ref:`Dependabot <Dependabot integration>`.
   When newer versions of the build dependencies become available,
   Dependabot updates the requirements file and submits a pull request.
   When adding or removing Sphinx extensions using Poetry,
   don't forget to update the requirements file as well.


.. _GitHub Actions workflows:

GitHub Actions workflows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The |HPC| uses `GitHub Actions`_
to implement continuous integration and delivery.
With GitHub Actions,
you define so-called workflows
using YAML_ files located in the ``.github/workflows`` directory.

A *workflow* is an automated process
consisting of one or many jobs,
each of which executes a series of steps.
Workflows are triggered by events,
for example when a commit is pushed
or when a release is published.
You can learn more about
the workflow language and its supported keywords
in the `official reference`__.

__ https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions

.. note::

   Real-time logs for workflow runs are available
   from the *Actions* tab in your GitHub repository.


Overview of workflows
---------------------

The |HPC| defines the following workflows:

.. table:: GitHub Actions workflows
   :class: hypermodern-table
   :widths: auto

   ===================================================== ======================== ==================================== =====================
   Workflow                                              File                     Description                          Trigger

   :ref:`Labeler <The Labeler workflow>`                 ``labeler.yml``          Manage GitHub project labels         Push (default branch)
   ===================================================== ======================== ==================================== =====================


Overview of GitHub Actions
--------------------------

Workflows use the following GitHub Actions:

.. table:: GitHub Actions
   :class: hypermodern-table
   :widths: auto

   ============================================ =========================================================
   `actions/cache`_                             Cache dependencies and build outputs

.. note::

   GitHub Actions used by the workflows are managed by :ref:`Dependabot <Dependabot integration>`.
   When newer versions of GitHub Actions become available,
   Dependabot updates the workflows that use them and submits a pull request.


.. _Workflow constraints:

Constraints file
----------------

GitHub Actions workflows install the following tools:

- pip_
- virtualenv_
- Poetry_
- Nox_

.. _virtualenv: https://virtualenv.pypa.io/

These dependencies are pinned using a `constraints file`_
located in ``.github/workflow/constraints.txt``.

.. _constraints file: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#constraints-files

.. note::

   The constraints file is managed by :ref:`Dependabot <Dependabot integration>`.
   When newer versions of the tools become available,
   Dependabot updates the constraints file and submits a pull request.


.. _The Tests workflow:

The Tests workflow
------------------

The Tests workflow runs checks using Nox.
It is triggered on every push to the repository,
and when a pull request is opened or receives new commits.

Each Nox session runs in a separate job,
using the current release of Python
and the `latest Ubuntu runner`__.
Selected Nox sessions also run on Windows and macOS,
and with older Python versions,
as shown in the table below:

__ https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/virtual-environments-for-github-hosted-runners#supported-runners-and-hardware-resources

.. table:: Jobs in the Tests workflow

   :ref:`coverage <The coverage session>`     Ubuntu                 3.9
   :ref:`docs-build <The docs-build session>` Ubuntu                 3.8
   ========================================== ====================== ==================

The workflow uploads the generated documentation as a `workflow artifact`__.
Building the documentation only serves the purpose of catching issues in pull requests.
Builds on `Read the Docs`_ happen independently.

__ https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/persisting-workflow-data-using-artifacts

The workflow also uploads coverage data to Codecov_ after running tests.
It generates a coverage report in Cobertura__ XML format,
using the :ref:`coverage session <The coverage session>`.
The report is uploaded
using the official `Codecov GitHub Action <codecov/codecov-action_>`__.

__ https://cobertura.github.io/cobertura/

The Tests workflow uses the following GitHub Actions:

- `actions/checkout`_ for checking out the Git repository
- `actions/setup-python`_ for setting up the Python interpreter
- `actions/download-artifact`_ to download the coverage data of each tests session
- `actions/cache`_ for caching pre-commit environments
- `actions/upload-artifact`_ to upload the generated documentation and the coverage data of each tests session
- `codecov/codecov-action`_ for uploading to Codecov_

The Tests workflow is defined in ``.github/workflows/tests.yml``.


.. _The Release workflow:

The Release workflow
--------------------

The Release workflow publishes your package on PyPI_, the Python Package Index.
The workflow also creates a version tag in the GitHub repository,
and publishes a GitHub Release using `Release Drafter`_.
The workflow is triggered on every push to the default branch.

Release steps only run if the package version was bumped.
If the package version did not change,
the package is instead uploaded to TestPyPI_ as a prerelease,
and only a draft GitHub Release is created.
TestPyPI is a test instance of the Python Package Index.

The Release workflow uses API tokens to access PyPI_ and TestPyPI_.
You can generate these tokens from your account settings on these services.
The tokens need to be stored as secrets in the repository settings on GitHub:

.. table:: Secrets
   :class: hypermodern-table
   :widths: auto

   =================== ===================
   ``PYPI_TOKEN``      PyPI_ API token
   ``TEST_PYPI_TOKEN`` TestPyPI_ API token
   =================== ===================

The Release workflow uses the following GitHub Actions:

- `actions/checkout`_ for checking out the Git repository
- `actions/setup-python`_ for setting up the Python interpreter
- `salsify/action-detect-and-tag-new-version`_ for tagging on version bumps
- `pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish`_ for uploading the package to PyPI or TestPyPI
- `release-drafter/release-drafter`_ for publishing the GitHub Release

Release notes are populated with the titles and authors of merged pull requests.
You can group the pull requests into separate sections
by applying labels to them, like this:

.. include:: quickstart.rst
   :start-after: table-release-drafter-sections-begin
   :end-before: table-release-drafter-sections-end

The workflow is defined in ``.github/workflows/release.yml``.
The Release Drafter configuration is located in ``.github/release-drafter.yml``.


.. _The Labeler workflow:

The Labeler workflow
--------------------

The Labeler workflow manages the labels used in GitHub issues
and pull requests based on a description file ``.github/labels.yaml``.
In this file each label is described with
a ``name``,
a ``description``
and a ``color``.
The workflow is triggered on every push to the default branch.

The workflow creates or updates project labels if they are missing
or different compared to the ``labels.yml`` file content.

The workflow does not delete labels already configured in the GitHub UI
and not in the ``labels.yml`` file.
You can change this behavior and add ignore patterns
in the settings of the workflow (see `GitHub Labeler`_ documentation).

The Labeler workflow uses the following GitHub Actions:

- `actions/checkout`_ for checking out the Git repository
- `crazy-max/ghaction-github-labeler`_ for updating the GitHub project labels

The workflow is defined in ``.github/workflows/labeler.yml``.
The GitHub Labeler configuration is located in ``.github/labels.yml``.

3. Click **Delete branch**.

This triggers the following automated steps:

- :ref:`The test suite runs against the main branch <The Tests workflow>`.
- :ref:`The draft GitHub Release is updated <The Release workflow>`.
- :ref:`A pre-release of the package is uploaded to TestPyPI <The Release workflow>`.
- `Read the Docs`_ rebuilds the *latest* version of the documentation.

In your local repository,
update the main branch:

.. code:: console

   $ git switch main
   $ git pull origin main

Optionally, remove the merged topic branch
from the local repository as well:

.. code:: console

   $ git remote prune origin
   $ git branch --delete --force my-topic-branch

The original commits remain accessible from the pull request
(*Commits* tab).


How to make a release
---------------------

Releases are triggered by a version bump on the default branch.
It is recommended to do this in a separate pull request:

1. Switch to a branch.
2. Bump the version using `poetry version`_.
3. Commit and push to GitHub.
4. Open a pull request.
5. Merge the pull request.

.. _poetry version: https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#version

The individual steps for bumping the version are:

.. code:: console

   $ git switch --create release main
   $ poetry version <version>
   $ git commit --message="<project> <version>" pyproject.toml
   $ git push origin release

If you're not sure which version number to choose,
read about `Semantic Versioning`_.
Versioning rules for Python packages are laid down in `PEP 440`_.

Before merging the pull request for the release,
go through the following checklist:

- The pull request passes all checks.
- The development release on TestPyPI_ looks good.
- All pull requests for the release have been merged.

Merging the pull request triggers the
:ref:`Release workflow <The Release workflow>`.
This workflow performs the following automated steps:

- Publish the package on PyPI.
- Publish a GitHub Release.
- Apply a Git tag to the repository.

`Read the Docs`_ automatically builds a new stable version of the documentation.
