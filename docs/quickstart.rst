Releasing
---------

Releases are triggered by a version bump on the default branch.
It is recommended to do this in a separate pull request:

1. Switch to a branch.
2. Bump the version using `poetry version`_.
3. Commit and push to GitHub.
4. Open a pull request.
5. Merge the pull request.

.. _poetry version: https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#version

The Release workflow performs the following automated steps:

- Build and upload the package to PyPI.
- Apply a version tag to the repository.
- Publish a GitHub Release.

Release notes are populated with the titles and authors of merged pull requests.
You can group the pull requests into separate sections
by applying labels to them, like this:

.. table-release-drafter-sections-begin

.. table::
   :class: hypermodern-table
   :widths: auto
