FAQ

  *What is this project about?*

The mission of this project is to
enable current best practices
through modern Python tooling.

  *What makes this project different from other Python templates?*

This is a general-purpose template for Python libraries and applications.

Our goals are:

- Focus on simplicity and minimalism
- Promote code quality through automation
- Provide reliable and repeatable processes

The project template is centered around the following tools:

- Poetry_ for packaging and dependency management
- Nox_ for automation of checks and other development tasks
- `GitHub Actions`_ for continuous integration and delivery

  *Why is this Python template called "hypermodern"?*

Hypermodernism_ is a school of chess that dates back to more than a century ago.
If this setup ever goes out of fashion,
I can pretend it was my secret plan from the start.
