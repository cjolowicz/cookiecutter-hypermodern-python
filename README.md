## Quickstart

### Requirements

Install Cookiecutter:

```console
$ pipx install cookiecutter
```

Install Poetry:

```console
$ curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python
```

Install Nox:

```console
$ pipx install nox
```

[pipx] is preferred, but you can also install with `pip install --user`.

It is recommended to set up Python 3.6, 3.7, and 3.8 using [pyenv].

[pipx]: https://github.com/pipxproject/pipx
[pyenv]: https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv

### Creating a project

Generate a Python project:

```console
$ cookiecutter gh:cjolowicz/cookiecutter-hypermodern-python --checkout=2020.3.27
```

Change to the root directory of your new project,
and create a Git repository:

```console
$ git init
$ git add .
$ git commit
```

### Local testing

Run the full test suite:

```console
$ nox
```

List the available Nox sessions:

```console
$ nox --list-sessions
```

### Continuous Integration

#### GitHub

1. Create an empty repository for your project.
2. Follow the instructions to push an existing repository from the command line.

#### PyPI

1. Sign up at [PyPI].
2. Go to the Account Settings on PyPI,
   generate an API token, and copy it.
3. Go to the repository settings on GitHub, and
   add a secret named `PYPI_TOKEN` with the token you just copied.

[pypi]: https://pypi.org/

#### TestPyPI

1. Sign up at [TestPyPI].
2. Go to the Account Settings on TestPyPI,
   generate an API token, and copy it.
3. Go to the repository settings on GitHub, and
   add a secret named `TEST_PYPI_TOKEN` with the token you just copied.

[testpypi]: https://test.pypi.org/

#### Codecov

1. Sign up at [Codecov], and install their GitHub app.
2. Add your repository to Codecov.

[codecov]: https://codecov.io/

#### Read the Docs

1. Sign up at [Read the Docs].
2. Import your GitHub repository, using the button _Import a Project_.

[read the docs]: https://readthedocs.org/

### Releasing

1. Bump the version using `poetry version`. Push to GitHub.
2. Publish a GitHub Release.
3. GitHub Action triggers the PyPI upload.

Release notes are pre-filled with titles and authors of merged pull requests.

Use labels to group the pull requests into sections:

| Label           | Section                                      |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `breaking`      | :boom: Breaking Changes                      |
| `bug`           | :beetle: Fixes                               |
| `build`         | :package: Build System and Dependencies      |
| `ci`            | :construction_worker: Continuous Integration |
| `documentation` | :books: Documentation                        |
| `enhancement`   | :rocket: Features                            |
| `performance`   | :racehorse: Performance                      |
| `refactoring`   | :hammer: Refactoring                         |
| `removal`       | :fire: Removals and Deprecations             |
| `style`         | :lipstick: Style                             |
| `testing`       | :rotating_light: Testing                     |

GitHub creates the `bug`, `enhancement`, and `documentation` labels for you.
Create the remaining labels on the Issues tab of your GitHub repository.

## Caveats

When upgrading Sphinx or its extensions using Poetry,
also update the requirements located in [docs/requirements.txt] for Read the Docs.
