The linter suite uses the following tools and Flake8 plugins:

- [darglint](https://github.com/terrencepreilly/darglint) to detect inaccurate docstrings
- [flake8-annotations](https://github.com/python-discord/flake8-annotations) to enforce type coverage
- [flake8-bandit](https://github.com/tylerwince/flake8-bandit) for integration with Bandit
- [flake8-black](https://github.com/peterjc/flake8-black) for integration with Black
- [flake8-bugbear](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8-bugbear) to detect bugs and design problems
- [flake8-docstrings](https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8-docstrings) for integration with pydocstyle
- [flake8-import-order](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8-import-order) to check the order of import statements
- [flake8-rst-docstrings](https://github.com/peterjc/flake8-rst-docstrings) to check that docstrings are valid reStructuredText
- [mccabe](https://github.com/PyCQA/mccabe) to limit the code complexity
- [pep8-naming](https://github.com/pycqa/pep8-naming) to enforce naming conventions from [PEP 8](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)

## Quickstart

### Requirements

Install Poetry:

```sh
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python
```

Install Nox:

```sh
pip install --user --upgrade nox
```

Install the latest Cookiecutter:

```sh
pip install --user --upgrade cookiecutter
```

It is also recommended to use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to
set up Python 3.6, 3.7, and 3.8.

### Creating a project

Generate a Python project:

```sh
cookiecutter https://github.com/cjolowicz/cookiecutter-hypermodern-python
```

Change to the root directory of your new project.

### Local testing

Run the full test suite:

```sh
nox
```

List the available Nox sessions:

```sh
nox --list-sessions
```

### External Services

#### PyPI

1. Sign up at [PyPI](https://pypi.org/).
2. Go to the Account Settings on PyPI,
   generate an API token,
   and copy it.
3. Go to the repository settings on GitHub,
   and add a secret named `PYPI_TOKEN`
   with the token you just copied.

#### TestPyPI

1. Sign up at [TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org/).
2. Go to the Account Settings on TestPyPI,
   generate an API token,
   and copy it.
3. Go to the repository settings on GitHub,
   and add a secret named `TEST_PYPI_TOKEN`
   with the token you just copied.

#### Codecov

1. Sign up at [Codecov](https://codecov.io/), and install their GitHub app.
2. Add your repository to Codecov.

#### Read the Docs

1. Sign up at [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/).
2. Import your GitHub repository, using the button _Import a Project_.

### Releasing

1. Bump the version using `poetry version`. Push to GitHub.
2. Publish a GitHub Release.
3. GitHub Action triggers the PyPI upload.

Release notes are pre-filled with titles and authors of merged pull requests.

Use labels to group the pull requests into sections:

| Label           | Section                                      |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `breaking`      | :boom: Breaking Changes                      |
| `bug`           | :beetle: Fixes                               |
| `build`         | :package: Build System and Dependencies      |
| `ci`            | :construction_worker: Continuous Integration |
| `documentation` | :books: Documentation                        |
| `enhancement`   | :rocket: Features                            |
| `performance`   | :racehorse: Performance                      |
| `refactoring`   | :hammer: Refactoring                         |
| `removal`       | :fire: Removals and Deprecations             |
| `style`         | :lipstick: Style                             |
| `testing`       | :rotating_light: Testing                     |

GitHub creates the `bug`, `enhancement`, and `documentation` labels for you.
Create the remaining labels on the Issues tab of your GitHub repository.

## Caveats

When upgrading Sphinx or its extensions using Poetry,
also update the requirements located in
[docs/requirements.txt]({{cookiecutter.project_name}}/docs/requirements.txt)
for Read the Docs.
