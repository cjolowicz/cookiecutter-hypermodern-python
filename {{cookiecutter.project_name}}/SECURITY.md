# 🔐 Security Policy

> Do not open issues that might have security implications!
> It is critical that security related issues are reported privately so we have time to address them before they become public knowledge.

Vulnerabilities can be reported by emailing core members:

- {{cookiecutter.author}} [{{cookiecutter.email}}](mailto:{{cookiecutter.email}})

Be sure to include as much detail as necessary in your report. As with reporting normal issues, a minimal reproducible example will help the maintainers address the issue faster. If you are able, you may also include a fix for the issue generated with git format-patch.
